# Seaborn Data Visualization with Tips Dataset

This Jupyter Notebook (`tips.ipynb`) focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization** using the built-in **`tips` dataset** from Seaborn. The goal of this notebook is to practice and demonstrate the use of various **Seaborn plots** to better understand data patterns, relationships, and distributions.

## üìö Dataset
- **Source**: `sns.load_dataset("tips")`
- The dataset contains information about tips received by waiters in a restaurant, including:
  - `total_bill`: Total bill amount
  - `tip`: Tip given
  - `sex`, `smoker`, `day`, `time`, `size`: Other customer attributes

## üìä Key Visualizations Used
The notebook includes various Seaborn plots for visual exploration:
- `scatterplot` ‚Äì for understanding relationships between numerical variables
- `lineplot` ‚Äì for trend analysis
- `barplot` ‚Äì for comparing categorical data
- `boxplot` ‚Äì for visualizing data spread and detecting outliers
- `violinplot` ‚Äì combining boxplot and KDE
- `histplot` ‚Äì for distribution analysis
- `pairplot` ‚Äì for multivariate data relationships

## üß† Objective
- Understand how to use Seaborn‚Äôs visualization functions
- Perform initial exploratory analysis
- Practice creating readable and informative plots

## üö´ No Machine Learning
> **Note**: This notebook does not include any machine learning or regression modeling. It is purely focused on visual analysis using Seaborn.

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used
- `Seaborn`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Pandas`
